## üéØ Program Overview

Quantitative Research (QR) is an expert quantitative modeling group at JPMorgan Chase, as well as a leader in financial engineering, data analytics, and portfolio management. As a global team, QR partners with traders, marketers, and risk managers across all products and regions and contributes to sales and client interaction, product innovation, valuation, risk management, inventory and portfolio optimization, electronic trading and market making, and appropriate financial risk controls.

The program provides hands-on experience with:
- **Commodity Trading**: Natural gas storage contracts and pricing models
- **Time Series Analysis**: Market forecasting and trend analysis  
- **Risk Management**: Credit risk analysis and default prediction
- **Statistical Modeling**: Machine learning applications in finance
- **Portfolio Optimization**: FICO score bucketing and risk assessment

## üìã Completed Tasks

This repository contains **4 comprehensive Jupyter notebooks** covering the core modules of the quantitative research experience:

### üìà Task 1: Natural Gas Storage Analysis
**Notebook**: `Task01_Natural_gas_storage_....ipynb`

Working with a commodity trading desk where Alex, a VP on the desk, wants to start trading natural gas storage contracts. The available market data must be of higher quality to enable the instrument to be priced accurately.

**Key Objectives:**
- Analyze historical natural gas price data to identify seasonal trends
- Implement time series forecasting using Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing
- Develop price estimation functions for future dates
- Create visualizations showing price patterns and volatility

**Technical Skills Applied:**
- Time series analysis and decomposition
- Seasonal pattern recognition
- Data visualization with matplotlib/seaborn
- Statistical forecasting methods

### üí∞ Task 2: Commodity Storage Pricing Model
**Notebook**: `Task02_Price_commodity_sto....ipynb`

Commodity storage contracts represent deals between warehouse (storage) owners and participants in the supply chain. The concept is simple: any trade agreement is as valuable as the price you can sell minus the price at which you are able to buy, minus any costs incurred.

**Key Objectives:**
- Develop a prototype pricing model for natural gas storage contracts
- Calculate contract values based on injection/withdrawal dates and storage costs
- Account for seasonal price differentials and storage facility fees
- Optimize profit scenarios for various contract parameters

**Technical Skills Applied:**
- Financial modeling and contract pricing
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Optimization algorithms
- Monte Carlo simulations (if applicable)

### üõ°Ô∏è Task 3: Credit Risk Analysis
**Notebook**: `Task03_Credit_risk_analysis.ipynb`

You have now moved to a new team assisting the retail banking arm, which has been experiencing higher-than-expected default rates on personal loans. The risk team has begun to look at the existing book of loans to see if more defaults should be expected in the future.

**Key Objectives:**
- Build predictive models to estimate probability of default (PD)
- Implement logistic regression and decision tree models
- Calculate expected loss incorporating recovery rates (10%)
- Analyze customer characteristics that influence default risk

**Technical Skills Applied:**
- Machine learning classification algorithms
- Logistic regression modeling
- Decision tree analysis
- Risk metrics calculation and interpretation

### üìä Task 4: FICO Score Bucketing Optimization  
**Notebook**: `Task04_Bucket_FICO_scores.ipynb`

This problem addresses bucketing FICO scores and considers how rough the discretization is and the density of defaults in each bucket. The problem could be addressed by splitting it into subproblems, which can be solved incrementally through a dynamic programming approach.

**Key Objectives:**
- Segment FICO scores into optimal buckets for risk assessment
- Implement dynamic programming solutions for bucketing optimization
- Calculate likelihood functions and probability distributions
- Balance bucket density with predictive accuracy

**Technical Skills Applied:**
- Dynamic programming and optimization
- Statistical bucketing techniques
- Likelihood function optimization
- Categorical data analysis
